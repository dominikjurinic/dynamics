# Numerical Methods of Dynamics of Structural Systems
Source code for dynamics simulation of  Mars's rover rocker bogey mechanism.

## Model
CAD Model was built using Solidworks (see `Rover.step`), coupled with project Chrono architecture (https://projectchrono.org/). Goal was to obtain qualitatively similar results to experimental data (Arvidson, R. E et al.).

## Results

## Note
In simulation, rover crosses over obstacle (rock) which generates change in resultant forces on wheels. Time interval of simulation is shorter due to simplification.
Resultant forces in absolute values ​​are not exact, as uniformly distributed mass density is assumed, which is not case for real rover, but decent qualitative result match is achieved.
